# ComplexVector
Container, analog of std::vector. Implemented move semantics for greater efficiency and reservation of "raw" memory with the construction of elements in it as needed.
# Building and Run
```
  1. mkdir BuildComplexVector && cd BuildComplexVector
  2. cmake ..
  3. cmake --build .
  4. Start ./complex_vector or complex_vector.exe
```
# System requirements and Stack
  1. C++17
  2. GCC version 8.1.0
  3. Cmake 3.21.2 (minimal 3.10)
# Future plans
